## 1. Introduction and Overview

This document describes the requirements for a multi-agent software system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), designed to **assist** the management team of a kindergarten in daily tasks, optimizing processes, automating repetitive tasks, providing decision support, and increasing overall efficiency.
The system will cover pedagogical, administrative, financial, human resources, infrastructure, communication, and legal compliance areas. A fundamental requirement is **flexibility** in the use of LLMs (Large Language Models), allowing the school to choose and configure access to models via OpenRouter, direct APIs (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic), or local instances (Ollama), ensuring control over costs, privacy, and performance, with mcp-agent [https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent] chosen as the framework due to its support for coordinating multiple agents and native integration with LLMs and other services through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
The ultimate goal is for the system to **enhance** human work, without replacing it in critical decisions, ensuring compliance (LGPD - Brazilian General Data Protection Law) and a good user experience.
