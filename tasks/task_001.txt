# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Core Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository, set up the basic file structure, and integrate the mcp-agent framework as the core multi-agent orchestrator. Establish the foundation for the web UI.
# Details:
Create a Git repository. Set up a Python backend (e.g., FastAPI) with mcp-agent library integrated. Define basic agent structure and orchestration flow (FR01). Set up a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue) shell for the web UI (FR02). Configure basic environment setup (e.g., Docker Compose).

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository creation. Confirm mcp-agent installation and basic import. Run the initial backend and frontend applications without errors. Check basic agent communication placeholder.
