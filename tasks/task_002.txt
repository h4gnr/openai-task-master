# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement User Authentication and RBAC
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement secure user login/logout functionality and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
# Details:
Implement user registration (admin-only initially) and login using secure methods (e.g., JWT, password hashing). Define initial roles (Principal, Financial/Legal, Pedagogical Coordinator, Admin Assistant) based on personas (FR04). Implement middleware to protect API endpoints based on roles. Store user data securely (NFR01).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for authentication logic. Integration tests for login/logout flow. Test endpoint access control for different defined roles. Verify password hashing and secure token handling.
