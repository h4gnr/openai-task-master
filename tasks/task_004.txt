# Task ID: 4
# Title: Setup Secure Knowledge Base Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the basic infrastructure for the secure Knowledge Base (KB) to store school documents and structured data.
# Details:
Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for structured data/metadata and configure secure file storage (e.g., S3, MinIO, or local encrypted storage) for documents (FR03). Implement basic CRUD operations for uploading, retrieving, and listing document metadata. Ensure data encryption at rest (NFR01).

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for KB service logic (CRUD operations). Test file upload and download functionality. Verify database schema creation. Check that stored files/data are encrypted as expected.
