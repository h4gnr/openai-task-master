# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Administrative & Operational Agent - Core Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Administrative Agent to handle core high-priority tasks like document template management, reminder generation, and semantic search.
# Details:
Create an `AdministrativeAgent` class using mcp-agent. Implement functionality for managing document templates (FR17 - storing/retrieving templates). Implement logic to query the KB for dates and generate reminders (FR20). Implement basic semantic search over documents in the KB using embeddings generated via the LLM interface (FR21 - requires vector DB setup or basic search). Access control enforced by RBAC.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for agent functions. Integration test: Upload a document template, then use the agent to retrieve it. Set a date in the KB, use the agent to generate a reminder. Upload documents, use the agent to perform semantic search and verify relevant results. Test role permissions.
