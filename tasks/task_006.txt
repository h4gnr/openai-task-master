# Title: Implement Financial Agent - Core Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Financial Agent to assist with basic financial data organization tasks.
# Details:
Create a `FinancialAgent` class using mcp-agent. Implement LLM-assisted expense categorization based on text descriptions (FR25). Implement logic to generate basic cash flow summaries from provided data (FR26 - initial data via manual input/simple structure). Implement functionality to draft collection notices using LLM based on provided details (FR27). Ensure agent does not perform actual accounting (FR28). Access control enforced by RBAC.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for agent functions. Integration test: Provide expense descriptions, verify categorization suggestions. Provide sample income/expense data, verify summary generation. Provide overdue details, verify draft notice generation. Test role permissions (e.g., Financial Director access).
