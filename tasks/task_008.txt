# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop LLM Configuration User Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the UI section for administrators to configure LLM connection settings.
# Details:
Build frontend components (React/Vue) for the LLM configuration page within the admin section (FR07). Allow selection of LLM provider (initially Ollama) and input fields for necessary details (e.g., Ollama server address, model name). Implement API calls to securely save and retrieve this configuration via the backend. Ensure only admin roles can access this page.

# Test Strategy:
UI component tests. End-to-end test: Log in as admin, navigate to settings, configure Ollama details, save, reload, and verify settings persist. Test that non-admin roles cannot access the page.
