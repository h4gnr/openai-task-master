# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Audit Logging and Basic Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up activity logging for audit purposes and implement initial measures for LGPD compliance.
# Details:
Integrate a logging framework. Implement logging for critical actions: user login/logout, document upload/access, agent invocation, configuration changes (FR05). Ensure logs include user ID, timestamp, and action details. Encrypt log files if they contain sensitive data. Define placeholder logic/policy stubs for data retention based on LGPD (NFR01).

# Test Strategy:
Verify logs are generated for specified actions. Check log format and content. Test log retrieval (if applicable). Review logging implementation against basic LGPD requirements (e.g., recording data access). Ensure logs are stored securely.
